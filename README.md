Morse Code program using Delphi

I am using this old CW program as my introduction to sharing code using github. I may
not update the code very much as it has been static for many years. If you find this
code some use I am very happy :-)

This morse code program was written 18 years ago back when the Delphi language was
in its early days. Delphi is an object oriented version of the Pascal language, with
a whole lot more features than I could name here. 

The CW program is a morse code learning aid used for the dual purpose of learning
the morse code and also to learn a few Delphi language features. At the time Windows 98
was being used along side Windows NT, and Delphi 3 was able to support both in 32 bit
mode. This program could run on either 98 or NT but did have to use some different code 
to make the speaker beep function. The Delphi code here has been tested to build at Delphi 
3 through Delphi XE2. The exe here is built with Delphi XE2 and is confirmed to run on 
Windows 10.

The program displays a rather busy looking tabbed dialog window like thes when it starts.

To sent some text as code, its just a matter of typing the text into the edit entry 
field, and then clicking the "Send text as code now" button. The default speed is rather
slow. This can be increased by selecting the "Set Options" tab at the top right. That will 
display the options:

The send using light scheme is just for amusement - I found it way harder to read!
